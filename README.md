# imageviewer
Web app for showing live images

Created for a party, camera images were stored live to the 'images' directory via an eye-fi card, this web app then displays them

Ideal for events, run fullscreen on tv's or projectors
The latest image is shown largest, older images are shown smaller in a row at the bottom of the screen.

Countdown clock code is also includedand just commented out, generally in this situation a countdown is nice
